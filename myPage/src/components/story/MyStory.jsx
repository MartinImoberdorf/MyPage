            In a few words, I will try to explain what was the beginning of everything...
            <br/><br/>
            I can start by saying that I love <span>video games</span>; so when I was a child I played for hours and hours, especially with one famous football game. But sometimes this generated discussions or complaints with my parents because I never did anything else in my free time. In my defence, I was a good student that always had great grades at school.
            <br/><br/>
            One day, I was in the middle of a game, when my dad appeared and sat behind me. I thought it would be to see me play and can show him how good I was at that game, but he said completely the opposite: <span>"with all the time you spend on those games you should have already learned how to program it, how to make it or even better"</span>, he got up and went away.
            <br/><br/>
            One night, my dad's phrase was still in my head, so I decided to search on the internet, especially on YouTube, when I found a channel called <span>La Geekipedia De Ernesto</span>. There appeared my first programming language, <span>Java</span>, and I remember I only saw one video and then I went to sleep.
            <br/><br/>
            Over time, I saw one video per day, and everything started to change when the time that I used to spend on video games started to use in learning programming. All the things I saw made me feel more and more passionate about this journey. Sometimes I can realize everything that I have learned and done, and I'm really proud of this amazing change in my life.
            <br/><br/>
            On other hand, I must highlight the dedication and talent of my mum to Maths; days and nights of doing maths exercises together. I remember when I was in primary school and the teacher taught us to divide, with a confusing mechanism. I didn't understand anything, so I came back home and explain to my mum. She had already taught to me multiplication tables, so we found a new and more efficient method to divide.
            <br/><br/>
            So with these experiences, with Maths and Programming, I have decided to study <span>Systems Engineering</span>.
            <br/><br/>
            Thanks, mom and dad!
